Creating the user index.
---
```
# Since we are dealing with one single node in my example the replicas are set to 0
# if you had more than 1 node in the cluster the default for number of replicas is 1 
# and will actually put an exact replica of your data on the second node. The shards 
# by default is 5 and this basically how elasticsearch can quickly find your data by 
# sharding it out to multiple nodes. 

curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/user?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    "settings" : {
        "index" : {
            "number_of_shards" : 5,
            "number_of_replicas" : 0
        }
    }
}
'
```

Create the mapping for the user index and type of profile.
---
```
# Here it is important to note that some fields we are choosing to store. Why would 
# we store some and not others? Well the reason is because assuming your _source is 
# not disabled you can retrieve all of your data no matter what. Elasticsearch will 
# by default put your field in the _source. But if you enforce storing to true it will pull 
# the field in the index itself rather than the _source. This is only used for large 
# data sets where the cost of parsing the source is high. I'm only using this as an 
# example for you to let you know it's possible.

curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/user/_mapping/profile?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    "profile" : {
        "properties" : {
            "full_name" : { "type" : "text", "store" : true },
            "bio" : { "type" : "text", "store" : true },
            "age" : { "type" : "integer" },
            "location" : { "type" : "geo_point" },
            "enjoys_coffee" : { "type" : "boolean" },
            "created_on" : {
                "type" : "date", 
                "format" : "date_time" 
            }
        }
    }
}
'
```
Now let's insert some data!
---
```
# We are going to insert three users just to show you how searching works. Here I am 
# actually telling elasticsearch what I want the ID of the document to be. You'll 
# see an ID of 1, 2 and 3. If you do not specify this elasticsearch will create an ID 
# for you by default. Sometimes this is fine because if you are dealing with more big 
# data that has no relation the ID isn't too big of a worry. However in applications 
# where you want to constantly update the data in elasticsearch such as a social network 
# you will want to add an ID.

curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/user/profile/1?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    "full_name" : "Andrew Puch",
    "bio" : "My name is Andrew. I am an agile DevOps Engineer who is passionate about working with Software as a Service based applications, REST APIs, and various web application frameworks.",
    "age" : 26,
    "location" : "41.1246110,-73.4232880",
    "enjoys_coffee" : true,
    "created_on" : "2015-05-02T14:45:10.000-04:00"
}
'

curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/user/profile/2?pretty=true -d '
{
    "full_name" : "Elon Musk",
    "bio" : "Elon Reeve Musk is a Canadian-American entrepreneur, engineer, inventor and investor. He is the CEO and CTO of SpaceX, CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors, and chairman of SolarCity.",
    "age" : 43,
    "location" : "37.7749290,-122.4194160",
    "enjoys_coffee" : false,
    "created_on" : "2015-05-02T15:45:10.000-04:00"
}
'

curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/user/profile/3?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    "full_name" : "Some Hacker",
    "bio" : "I am a haxor user who you should end up deleting.",
    "age" : 1000,
    "location" : "37.7749290,-122.4194160",
    "enjoys_coffee" : true,
    "created_on" : "2015-05-02T16:45:10.000-04:00"
}
'
```

Now time to update a record.
---
```
# Pretending we are running a real social networking application. And let's say I 
# just relocated to a new City and State! We are going to want to update our record. 
# So let's do that. It's important here that we specify "doc" and _update because if 
# you don't you will wipe out your record ;)

curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/user/profile/1/_update?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    "doc" : {
        "location" : "40.7127840,-74.0059410"
    }
}
'
```

We noticed a bad user. Let's delete them.
---
```
# So not only will you need to update and insert records but if users are moving in and
# out of your system docs will need to be deleted. In our case for this demo we notice
# that there is a bad user. Lets remove them.

curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/user/profile/3?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Updating more than one at a time!
---
```
# So since Elon is pretty much the most amazing human in the world he wants to update
# his name to Elon Musk The Great. Alongside of that I decided that I want to update 
# my age to 27. The best way to perform more than one action at a time in elasticsearch
# is through the bulk API. In my repository there is the bulk.json file.

curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/_bulk?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @bulk.json
```

Now let's query that data!
---
```
# Let's search for the word "engineer" you'll notice we get both our users back because 
# engineer is in both of their profiles.

curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/user/profile/_search?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{ 
    "query" : {
        "query_string" : {
            "query" : "engineer"
        }
    }
}
'

# Now let's just search for users who have "investor" in their profile. You will notice
# we only get back Elon's profile.

curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/user/profile/_search?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{ 
    "query" : {
        "query_string" : {
            "query" : "investor"
        }
    }
}
'

# Okay, okay lets do something fun. Let's try to find ONLY the users who enjoy drinking coffee.

curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/user/profile/_search?pretty=true -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{ 
    "query" : {
        "bool" : {
            "must" : [
                {
                    "term" : {
                        "enjoys_coffee" : true
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

# That was cool and all but now we want to find out which users were created within
# a certain time range who don't enjoy coffee! Seriously who could not enjoy endless
# amounts of coffee though? Coffee rulezzz.

Conclusion
---
Hope that was extremely useful for anyone trying to figure out how to do different things within elasticsearch. I know it is a big struggle learning from the get go. There is great documentation everywhere but no real good step by step solution to putting some data in and getting it out. Hopefully this helped!!!!! If you want to get notified when I post new repositories for tutorials or post new videos on youtube please follow me here and subscribe on youtube. Thanks everyone!
